\description{
This function creates an object to manipulate data for qualitative analysis.
The data is stored in a SQLite database by default, but can be configures to
work with any SQL database through the `DBI` R package interface. Although
you can manipulate the SQL database directly, we recommend using the methods
(functions) defined in the returned object. This will ensure data integrity.

\describe{
   \item{\code{add_text(df, id_col, text_col, overwrite = TRUE, append = FALSE)}}{Adds text data to the object. There needs to be at least two columns, the column containing the text and a column containing a unique identifier (i.e. primary key). You can include any other columns that will be available in the Shiny app for analysis.}
