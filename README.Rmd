Package documentation: https://jbryer.github.io/ShinyQDA/

The `ShinyQDA` package is designed to assist researchers with the analysis of qualitative data. As the name suggests, the premise is that much of the interaction with the package will be done through a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application. However, all the functionality in the Shiny application is available through through the R command line as well. `ShinyQDA` attempts to set in between traditional qualitative data analysis that involves researchers coding and/or scoring (using rubrics) documents/text and natural language processing such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text encoding (i.e. tokenization). By using Shiny, multiple researchers can access the application to code and/or score documents. 

*Note: Qualitative data researchers tend to refer to the text they analyze as documents. Natural language processing researchers tend to refer to the data as text data. We try to prefer to use the phrase most appropriate for how a feature may be used, but they can often be used interchangeably. *

To install, use the `remotes` package:

```
remotes::install_github('jbryer/ShinyQDA')
```

Run the Shiny app with:

```
ShinyQDA::shinyQDA()
```

## Setup

```
qda_data <- qda(file = 'ShinyQDA.sqlite')
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by the [`shinymanager`](https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/) R package. By default, if authentication is enabled, ShinyQDA will create an administrator user with `admin` and `pass` as the username and password. We recommend changing the password after your first sign-in. User management (including password changing) is handled by clicking the plus (`+`) icon in the lower right hand corner. This will take you into `shinymanager`'s user management mode. All data entered into ShinyQDA has a username associated with it. When in authentication mode the username will be retrieved from `shinymanager`, otherwise ShinyQDA will use the value of `Sys.info()['user']`.

## ShinyQDA Features

Data entry, coding, and scoring features

* User management via the [`shinymanager`](https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/) package to allow multiple coders to work on the same dataset over the internet.
* Define an arbitrary set of questions/codes to assign to each document. Current question types include checkbox (for multiple selections), radio (for choose one from a list), and open text.
* Highlight text (e.g. word, sentence, paragraph, etc.) of text to code. This will open a modal dialog to add codes.
* Define an arbitrary set of questions/codes to assign to each coding (i.e. highlighted text).  Current question types include checkbox (for multiple selections), radio (for choose one from a list), and open text.
* Score documents using a rubric.

Analysis features: 

* Basic descriptive information for individual documents including character, word, sentence, and paragraph counts.
* Sentiment analysis at the individual document level. Words within the document that appear in the specified sentiment dictionary are highlighted and color coded to correspond to a histogram of the sentiments within a single document.
* Sentiment analysis across the entire database. Varying plots are provided approproate to the sentiment dictionary specified.
* Co-occurrence plot to examine how codes co-occur across documents.
* Word frequency analysis across the entire database.
* Code frequency analysis across all codes entered.
* Word clouds.

Data export features:

* A data table view showing all documents along with imported metadata, codes, code question responses, document descriptive statistics, and sentiment. Data can be exported/downloaded as CSV or Excel.
* A raw database view is provided with the ability to export/download as Excel (using multiple tabs) or raw SQLite database.

## Roadmap

* Ability to see other coders responses (for the text questions).
* Merge coding results into data export tab. Allow user to choose aggregation method.
* Inter-rater reliability analysis. For coding have a split view.
* Topic modeling
* Tokenization - allow the user to define and export/download various tokenization schemes.
* Predictive modeling - use any data (including sentiment, topics, tokenizations, etc.) to predict an outcome.
* Queuing and user roles - Create a scheme to limit access to certain features depending on user role. Allow documents to be assigned to users to code/score.
* Make the app prettier / improve the design. An alternative design has been started in inst/bs4dash/
* Convert the coding tab to use the Shiny module framework.
* New hex logo (my design skills are not great, looking for a volunteer ðŸ˜œ)
* Submit to CRAN when development is stable.
